# Design & Implement CI/CD Pipelines using Jenkins | Hands-On

Design & Implement CI/CD Pipelines using Jenkins | Hands-On

# What's in this course?

CI/CD is the backbone of modern DevOps, and Jenkins remains one of the most powerful and widely adopted automation servers in the industry. From simple freestyle jobs to cloud-native pipelines running on Kubernetes and Amazon Web Services, Jenkins enables teams to build, test, secure, and deploy applications at scale.

This hands-on, project-driven course takes you from beginner to confidently building production-ready CI/CD pipelines. You’ll install and configure Jenkins, create freestyle and pipeline jobs, and integrate with tools like Git, Apache Maven, Docker, Ansible, and Terraform. You’ll build Java and Python pipelines, implement secure credentials management, configure dynamic agents, and deploy real applications to Kubernetes clusters while applying monitoring and performance best practices.

By the end, you’ll be able to design, optimize, and scale Jenkins-based CI/CD systems just like modern DevOps teams in real production environments.
